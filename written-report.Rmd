knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, 
                      warning = FALSE, 
                      message = FALSE)

```{r read-data}

```

```{r filter-data}
police <- police %>% 
  filter(subject_race != "unknown" & subject_race != "NA")
```


## Introduction and Data



## Methodology

race~citation
age~citation
sex~citation

segmented bar graph w/ probability of citation based on race. 

```{r bargraph}
ggplot(police, aes(x = subject_race, fill = citation_issued)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "fill")
```


## Results

```{r chisq}
police %>% 
  chisq_test(formula = citation_issued ~ subject_race)
```
